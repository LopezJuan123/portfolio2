            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi! I'm a passionate designer with a bachelor's degree in Graphic Design and a minor in Psychology from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. My academic choices were driven by a fascination with understanding human behavior, particularly how people interact with technology.

<br><br>For the past three years, I've been honing my skills at Beeso Studio, working closely with startups and technology companies. As the sole designer, I took on diverse responsibilities, from creating logos and style guides to developing lo-fi and hi-fi designs tailored to client needs. Along the way, I’ve gained invaluable insight into the intricacies of building and scaling businesses.

<br><br>Outside of work, I stay active by hiking, exercising, and taking long walks in my city's downtown park. I cherish time spent with friends and family and have recently picked up learning Japanese as a new hobby.

<br><br>Let’s connect and create something amazing!<br><br>
            </p>
